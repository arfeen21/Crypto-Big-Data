# Crypto-Big-Data
his project aims to deliver a dashboard that gives insight into the impact of popular Tweets on the price of BTC and $TSLA.

For retrieval of the BTC price data we make use of the API provided by https://www.cryptocompare.com/

For retrieval of $TSLA stock data we use the Yahoo Finance API wrapped by the Python library 'yfinance'. This library can be found at https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance
